<section id="css-comments-and-basic-color-properties"></section>
  

On our third day, we'll cover how to add comments to your CSS code for
better readability and maintainability. We'll also dive into one of the
most fundamental aspects of styling: CSS color properties, focusing on
how to define colors for text and backgrounds.

## CSS Comments
<section id="css-comments"></section>
Comments in CSS are used to explain your code, make it more readable, or
temporarily disable parts of your stylesheet. Browsers ignore comments,
so they don't affect the functionality of your CSS.

CSS comments start with `/*` and end with `*/`.
They can span multiple lines.

**Syntax:**

```css
/* This is a single-line comment */

p {
  color: green; /* Set paragraph text color to green */
  font-size: 16px;
}

/*
This is a
multi-line comment.
It can be used to explain a larger block of code
or to temporarily comment out a section.

.unused-style {
  background-color: red;
  border: 1px solid black;
}
*/

h1 {
  /* color: blue; Temporarily disabled this rule */
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

### Why Use Comments?
<section id="why-use-comments"></section>
* **Explanation:** Clarify complex or non-obvious CSS rules
  for yourself or other developers.
* **Organization:** Divide your stylesheet into logical
  sections.
* **Debugging:** Temporarily disable rules to isolate
  issues.
* **Documentation:** Provide information about authorship,
  version, or purpose of the styles.

**Tip:** Write comments that explain *why* you did
something, not just *what* you did. Good code often explains
itself, but the reasoning behind a choice might not be obvious.

## Basic CSS Color Properties
<section id="basic-css-color-properties"></section>
Color is a fundamental aspect of web design. CSS provides several
properties to control the colors of various parts of your HTML elements.
Today, we'll focus on two primary ones: `color` for text and
`background-color` for element backgrounds.

We'll explore different ways to define color values (like keywords, hex,
RGB) in a later lesson. For now, we'll primarily use named colors and
simple hex codes.

### 1. The `color` Property
<section id="the-color-property"></section>
The `color` property is used to set the color of the text
content of an HTML element.

**Example:**

```css
/* styles.css */
h1 {
  color: navy; /* Sets the text color of h1 elements to navy */
}

p {
  color: #333333; /* Sets paragraph text color to a dark gray */
}

.special-text {
  color: crimson; /* Sets text color for elements with class 'special-text' */
}
```

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<h1>Main Title</h1>
<p>This is a standard paragraph with dark gray text.</p>
<p class="special-text">This paragraph has special crimson text.</p>
```

In this example, `<h1>` elements will have navy blue
text, regular paragraphs will have dark gray text, and any element with
the class `special-text` will have crimson text.

### 2. The `background-color` Property
<section id="the-background-color-property"></section>
The `background-color` property sets the background color of
an element. The background extends to the outer edge of the element's
padding (or border if `box-sizing: border-box` is used and
padding is included).

**Example:**

```css
/* styles.css */
body {
  background-color: #f0f8ff; /* AliceBlue background for the whole page */
}

div.highlight {
  background-color: yellow;
  padding: 10px; /* Padding to see the background color better */
}

button {
  background-color: seagreen;
  color: white; /* Text color on the button */
  padding: 8px 15px;
  border: none;
}
```

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<body>
  <div class="highlight">
    This div has a yellow background.
  </div>
  <p>This paragraph is on the page's AliceBlue background.</p>
  <button>Click Me</button>
</body>
```

Here, the entire page background is set to a light blue (AliceBlue). The
`div` with class `highlight` has a yellow
background. The button has a seagreen background and white text for
contrast.

### Named Colors
<section id="named-colors"></section>
CSS supports a list of predefined
[named colors](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp)
(e.g., `red`, `blue`, `green`,
`lightcoral`, `mediumseagreen`). These are easy to
remember and use for basic styling or quick prototyping.

**Example using named colors:**

Tomato

DodgerBlue

Gold

```css
.error-message {
  color: red;
  background-color: lightpink;
}

.success-message {
  color: green;
  background-color: lightgreen;
}

nav {
  background-color: steelblue;
  padding: 1em;
}

nav a {
  color: white;
}
```

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<nav>
  <a href="#">Home</a> | <a href="#">About</a>
</nav>
<p class="error-message">Something went wrong!</p>
<p class="success-message">Operation successful!</p>
```

While named colors are convenient, for more precise color control and a
wider range of colors, you'll often use hexadecimal, RGB, or HSL values,
which we will cover in detail in Week 5.
