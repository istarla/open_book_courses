# Background Properties
<section id="css-comments-and-basic-color-properties"></section>
  

Yesterday we covered basic color properties. Today, we'll expand on that
by exploring the various CSS properties used to control the background
of HTML elements. This includes not just colors, but also images, their
repetition, position, and size.

## Recap: `background-color`
<section id="recap-background-color"></section>

As we learned, `background-color` sets a solid color for the
background of an element.

```css
.element {
  background-color: #f0e68c; /* Khaki */
}
```

## `background-image`
<section id="background-image"></section>
The `background-image` property sets one or more background
images for an element. The image is specified using the
`url()` function.

This box has a tiled background image.

```css
.hero-section {
  background-image: url("images/hero-banner.jpg");
  /* If the image can't be found, it's good to have a fallback color */
  background-color: #cccccc;
  height: 400px; /* Set a height to see the background */
  color: white; /* Text color for contrast */
  text-align: center;
  padding: 20px;
}
```

By default, if the background image is smaller than the element, it will
repeat to fill the element.

## `background-repeat`
<section id="background-repeat"></section>
The `background-repeat` property controls if and how a
background image repeats.

Common values:

* `repeat`: The default value. The image is repeated both
  horizontally and vertically.
* `repeat-x`: The image is repeated only horizontally.
* `repeat-y`: The image is repeated only vertically.
* `no-repeat`: The image is not repeated. It will only be
  shown once.
* `space`: The image is repeated as much as possible without
  clipping. The first and last images are pinned to either side of the
  element, and whitespace is distributed evenly between the images.
* `round`: The image is repeated and squished or stretched to
  fill the space with whole tiles.

`background-repeat: no-repeat;`

```css
.header-pattern {
  background-image: url("patterns/small-pattern.png");
  background-repeat: repeat-x; /* Repeat horizontally along the top */
  height: 50px;
}

.sidebar-icon {
  background-image: url("icons/info.svg");
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  padding-left: 30px; /* Make space for the icon */
  background-position: left center; /* We'll cover this next */
}
```

## `background-position`
<section id="background-position"></section>
The `background-position` property sets the initial position
of a background image. If `background-repeat` is set to
`no-repeat`, this property determines where the single image
is placed.

Values can be keywords (`top`, `bottom`,
`left`, `right`, `center`),
percentages, or length units.

**Keyword examples:** `top left`,
`center center`, `bottom right`,
`center` (equivalent to `center center`).

**Percentage/Length examples:**
`50% 50%` (center), `20px 10px` (20px from left,
10px from top).

`background-position: center center;`

```css
.icon-button {
  background-image: url("icons/arrow-right.png");
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position: right center; /* Icon on the right, vertically centered */
  padding-right: 25px; /* Space for the icon */
}

.full-bg-image {
  background-image: url("images/scenic.jpg");
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position: center top; /* Center horizontally, at the top */
  height: 300px;
}
```

## `background-size`
<section id="background-size"></section>
The `background-size` property specifies the size of the
background images.

Common values:

* `auto`: The default value. The image is displayed in its
  original size.
* `cover`: Scales the image (while preserving its aspect
  ratio) to be as large as possible so that the background area is
  completely covered by the background image. Some parts of the
  background image may not be in view.
* `contain`: Scales the image (while preserving its aspect
  ratio) to the largest size such that both its width and its height can
  fit inside the content area.
* `<length>`: Sets a specific size (e.g.,
  `100px 50px` for width and height). A single value sets the
  width, and height becomes `auto`.
* `<percentage>`: Sets the size in percentage of the
  parent element.

`background-size: cover;` (Random nature image)

`background-size: contain;` (Random technology image)

```css
.promo-banner {
  background-image: url("images/large-promo.jpg");
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position: center;
  background-size: cover; /* Ensures the image covers the banner area */
  height: 250px;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  color: white;
  font-size: 2em;
  text-shadow: 2px 2px 4px #000000;
}

.logo-container {
  background-image: url("images/company-logo.svg");
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position: center;
  background-size: contain; /* Ensures the entire logo is visible */
  width: 150px;
  height: 75px;
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
}
```

**Tip:** When using `background-size: cover`,
ensure that important parts of your image are near the center, as
edges might get cropped on different screen sizes.

## `background-attachment`
<section id="background-attachment"></section>
The `background-attachment` property sets whether a
background image scrolls with the rest of the page, or is fixed.

Common values:

* `scroll`: The default value. The background image scrolls
  with the page.
* `fixed`: The background image is fixed with regard to the
  viewport. It does not scroll with its containing element. This can
  create a parallax effect.
* `local`: The background image scrolls with the element's
  content. If the element has a scrollbar, the background scrolls with
  it.

```css
body {
  /* This example is best seen on a page with enough content to scroll */
  /* For a parallax effect: */
  /* background-image: url("images/parallax-bg.jpg");
  background-attachment: fixed;
  background-position: center;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-size: cover;
  min-height: 1000px; /* Ensure scrollability */
  */
}

.scrolling-content-box {
  width: 300px;
  height: 200px;
  overflow: auto; /* Make content scrollable */
  background-image: url("patterns/light-pattern.png");
  background-attachment: local;
  border: 1px solid black;
  padding: 10px;
}
```

This box has `background-attachment: local`. Scroll inside
this box to see the effect.   
More content...

## Shorthand: `background` Property
<section id="shorthand-background-property"></section>
You can combine all these background properties into a single shorthand
property: `background`. The order for the values is generally
recommended as:

`background: [background-color] [background-image] [background-repeat]
[background-attachment] [background-position] / [background-size];`

(The `background-size` must be specified after
`background-position`, separated by a '`/`'.)

```css
.complex-background {
  background: lightblue url("images/bg-texture.png") no-repeat fixed center center / cover;
  height: 500px;
  color: #333;
  padding: 20px;
  border: 1px solid #aaa;
}

/* A simpler example */
.simple-bg {
  background: #eee url("icons/info.png") no-repeat left center;
  padding: 10px 10px 10px 30px; /* Left padding for icon */
}
```

Not all values need to be present, but the order can matter for parsing,
especially with `background-size`.

## Quiz Time!

1. Which CSS property is used to set an image as the background of an
element?

`background-image`

2. What is the default value for `background-repeat`?

`repeat` (the image is repeated both horizontally and
vertically).

3. How can you make a background image cover the entire element,
potentially cropping parts of the image, while maintaining its aspect
ratio?

Using `background-size: cover;`.

4. What does `background-attachment: fixed;` do?

It fixes the background image relative to the viewport, so it doesn't
scroll with its containing element, creating a parallax-like effect.

5. Write the shorthand CSS `background` property to set a
background color of `#f0f0f0`, an image named
`flower.png` that does not repeat, and is positioned in the
top right corner.

Answer

```
.element {
      background: #f0f0f0 url("flower.png") no-repeat top right;
    }
```

(Note: `background-size` would be added after position with a
`/` if needed, and `background-attachment` could
also be included.)
