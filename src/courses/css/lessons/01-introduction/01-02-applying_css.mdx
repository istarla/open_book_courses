# Applying CSS (Inline, Internal, External)
<section id="Applying-CSS"></section>

  

Yesterday, we learned what CSS is and its basic syntax. Today, we'll
focus on the different ways you can apply CSS rules to an HTML document:
inline styles, internal stylesheets, and external stylesheets.
Understanding these methods is crucial for organizing your styles
effectively.

## 1. Inline Styles
<section id="inline-styles"></section>

Inline styles are applied directly to individual HTML elements using the
`style` attribute. Each declaration is written directly
within the attribute's value, separated by semicolons.

**Syntax:**

```css
<element style="property1: value1; property2: value2;">...</element>
```

**Example:**

```css
<h1 style="color: blue; text-align: center;">This is a Blue, Centered Heading</h1>
<p style="font-size: 18px; background-color: lightyellow;">This paragraph has a larger font and a light yellow background.</p>
```

  

### Pros and Cons of Inline Styles:
<section id="pros-and-cons-of-inline-styles"></section>
**Pros:**
  + Quick for testing or applying a unique style to a single element.
  + Highest specificity in the cascade (unless overridden by
    `!important`).
**Cons:**
  + Mixes presentation with content, making HTML harder to read and
    maintain.
  + Not reusable; styles must be individually applied to each element.
  + Difficult to manage for larger websites.
  + Generally considered bad practice for structuring site-wide
    styles.

**Note:** Inline styles should be used sparingly. They
are often used in HTML emails (due to limited CSS support in some
email clients) or by JavaScript to dynamically change styles.

## 2. Internal Stylesheets (Embedded CSS)
<section id="internal-stylesheets"></section>
Internal stylesheets are defined within the
`<style>` element, placed inside the
`<head>` section of an HTML document. The CSS rules
written here apply only to the current HTML page.

**Syntax:**

```css
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Internal CSS Example</title>
  <style>
    body {
      background-color: #f0f0f0;
    }
    h1 {
      color: green;
      font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;
    }
    p {
      font-size: 16px;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Heading Styled with Internal CSS</h1>
  <p>This paragraph is also styled by the internal stylesheet.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

### Pros and Cons of Internal Stylesheets:
<section id="pros-and-cons-of-internal-stylesheets"></section>
**Pros:**
  + Keeps styles for a single page in one place.
  + Selectors and classes can be used, allowing styles to be applied
    to multiple elements on the page.
  + No extra HTTP request is needed to fetch the CSS file (unlike
    external stylesheets).
**Cons:**
  + Styles are only for the current page; cannot be reused across
    multiple pages of a website.
  + For larger websites, this can lead to code duplication if similar
    styles are needed on different pages.
  + Increases the size of the HTML document.

**Note:** Internal stylesheets are useful for single-page
websites or for styles that are truly unique to one specific page.

## 3. External Stylesheets
<section id="external-stylesheets"></section>

External stylesheets are the most common and recommended method for
applying CSS. Styles are defined in separate `.css` files
(e.g., `styles.css`), which are then linked to HTML documents
using the `<link>` element within the
`<head>` section.

**Syntax:**

First, create a CSS file (e.g., `mystyles.css`):

```css
/* mystyles.css */
body {
  font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
  line-height: 1.6;
  background-color: #e9ecef;
}

header {
  background-color: #333;
  color: white;
  padding: 1rem 0;
  text-align: center;
}

.container {
  width: 80%;
  margin: auto;
  overflow: hidden;
  padding: 20px;
}
```

Then, link this CSS file in your HTML document:

```css
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>External CSS Example</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="mystyles.css">
</head>
<body>
  <header>
    <h1>Website Title</h1>
  </header>
  <div class="container">
    <p>This page uses an external stylesheet for its design.</p>
  </div>
</body>
</html>
```

The `<link>` element has a few important attributes:

* `rel="stylesheet"`: Specifies the relationship between the
  HTML document and the linked file.
* `type="text/css"`: Specifies the media type of the linked
  document (though this is often omitted in HTML5 as it's the default
  for `rel="stylesheet"`).
* `href="mystyles.css"`: Specifies the path to the CSS file.

### Pros and Cons of External Stylesheets:
<section id="pros-and-cons-of-external-stylesheets"></section>
**Pros:**
  + **Separation of Concerns:** Keeps HTML (content) and
    CSS (presentation) completely separate.
  + **Reusability:** The same CSS file can be linked to
    multiple HTML pages, ensuring a consistent look and feel across an
    entire website.
  + **Maintainability:** Easier to manage and update
    styles for large websites, as changes in one
    `.css` file can affect many pages.
  + **Caching:** Browsers can cache external CSS files,
    leading to faster page loads on subsequent visits.
  + **Cleaner HTML:** HTML markup remains cleaner and
    more semantic.
**Cons:**
  + Requires an additional HTTP request to load the CSS file (though
    caching mitigates this).
  + Pages might not render correctly until the external CSS is fully
    loaded (though this is usually very fast).
```css
**Best Practice:** For most web development projects,
external stylesheets are the preferred method for managing CSS.
```
## Order of Precedence (The Cascade)
<section id="order-of-precedence-the-cascade"></section>
When multiple styles are applied to the same element, the browser needs
to decide which style to use. This is where the "Cascading" part of CSS
comes in. The general order of precedence is (from lowest to highest):

1. Browser default styles
2. External stylesheets
3. Internal stylesheets
4. Inline styles

Styles marked with `!important` can override this order, but
should be used with extreme caution. We'll delve deeper into specificity
and the cascade in a later lesson.
