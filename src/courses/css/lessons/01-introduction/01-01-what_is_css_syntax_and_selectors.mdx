# Introduction to css
Welcome to the first day of your CSS journey! Today, we'll explore the
fundamental concepts of CSS: what it is, its basic syntax, and how to
use selectors to target HTML elements for styling.

## What is CSS?
<section id="what-is-css"></section>

CSS stands for **Cascading Style Sheets**. It's a
stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document
written in a markup language like HTML. CSS dictates how HTML elements
should be displayed on screen, on paper, or in other media. Essentially,
CSS is responsible for the look and feel of a web page â€“ its layout,
colors, fonts, and overall visual appearance.

Without CSS, web pages would be plain text with unstyled HTML elements.
CSS allows developers to separate the content (HTML) from the
presentation (CSS), making websites easier to maintain, more flexible,
and capable of sophisticated designs.

## CSS Syntax
<section id="css-syntax"></section>

A CSS rule consists of a selector and a declaration block:

* **Selector:** Points to the HTML element(s) you want to
  style.
* **Declaration Block:** Contains one or more declarations
  separated by semicolons. Each declaration includes a CSS property name
  and a value, separated by a colon.

Here's the basic structure:

```css
selector {
  property: value; /* This is a declaration */
  another-property: another-value; /* Another declaration */
}
```

For example, to make all paragraph (`<p>`) elements red
and have a font size of 16 pixels, the CSS rule would be:

```css
p {
  color: red;
  font-size: 16px;
}
```

## Basic CSS Selectors
<section id="basic-css-selectors"></section>

Selectors are patterns that select the HTML elements you want to style.
Here are some of the most basic and commonly used selectors:

### 1. Element Selector (or Type Selector)
<section id="element-selector"></section>

This selector targets all HTML elements of a specific type.

**Example:** Selects all `<h2>` elements.

```css
h2 {
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  text-align: center;
}
```

This rule would apply the Arial font (or a generic sans-serif font if
Arial is not available) and center-align the text for all
`<h2>` headings on the page.

### 2. Class Selector
<section id="class-selector"></section>

The class selector targets HTML elements that have a specific
`class` attribute. To select elements with a specific class,
write a period (`.`) character, followed by the class name.

**HTML Example:**

```html
<p class="highlight">This paragraph will be highlighted.</p>
<div class="highlight">This div will also be highlighted.</div>
<p>This paragraph will not.</p>
```

**CSS Example:** Selects all elements with
`class="highlight"`.

```css
.highlight {
  background-color: yellow;
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

An element can have multiple classes, separated by spaces (e.g.,
`class="highlight important"`). You can target elements with
multiple specific classes by chaining them without spaces (e.g.,
`.highlight.important`).

### 3. ID Selector
<section id="id-selector"></section>

The ID selector targets a single HTML element that has a specific
`id` attribute. IDs must be unique within an HTML document.
To select an element with a specific ID, write a hash (`#`)
character, followed by the ID of the element.

**HTML Example:**

```html
<div id="main-header">This is the main header.</div>
```

**CSS Example:** Selects the element with
`id="main-header"`.

```css
main-header {
  padding: 20px;
  border-bottom: 1px solid #ccc;
}
```

While powerful, ID selectors have high specificity and should be used
sparingly, often for unique page landmarks or JavaScript hooks, rather
than general styling.

### 4. Universal Selector
<section id="universal-selector"></section>


The universal selector (`*`) selects all HTML elements on the
page. It's often used to apply global resets or default styles, but
should be used with caution as it can have performance implications and
override desired styles if not handled carefully.

**CSS Example:** Applies a red border to every element (not
generally recommended for this purpose, but illustrates the selector).

```css
* {
  /* A common use case is for box-sizing reset: */
  /* box-sizing: border-box; */
  /* Example for illustration: */
  border: 1px dotted red; /* Not practical for all elements */
}
```

A more practical use is setting a default box-sizing for all elements:

```css
*,
*::before,
*::after {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

### 5. Grouping Selector
<section id="grouping-selector"></section>

You can apply the same styles to multiple selectors by grouping them
with commas. This helps to reduce code duplication.

**CSS Example:** Applies the same styles to
`<h1>`, `<h2>`, and
`<p>` elements.

```css
h1, h2, p {
  color: navy;
  margin-bottom: 10px;
}
```
