# Control Flow - The **if-else** Statement
<section id="Introduction-to-if-else-Statements"></section>
## Handling the Alternative: The Need for **else**

Yesterday, we learned about the `if` statement, which executes a block of code only when a condition is true. But what if we want to execute a **different** block of code specifically when the condition is false?

This is where the `else` clause comes in. An `if-else` statement provides two possible paths of execution: one for when the condition is true, and another for when it's false.

## The if-else Statement Syntax
<section id="if-else-statement-syntax"></section>

The structure builds directly on the `if` statement:

```python
if condition:
    # Block 1: Executes if condition is True
    statement_if_true_1
    statement_if_true_2
else:
    # Block 2: Executes if condition is False
    statement_if_false_1
    statement_if_false_2
# Code here executes after either Block 1 or Block 2 has finished
statement_after_if_else
```

* **Key components:**
*   **if condition:**: Same as before, evaluates the condition.
*   <span className="highlight">Indented Block 1</span>: Executed only if the condition is `True`.
*   **else:**: The keyword that introduces the alternative block. It must be at the same indentation level as the corresponding `if`. It does **not** have its own condition.
*   <span className="highlight">Indented Block 2</span>: Executed only if the original `if` condition evaluates to `False`.

<div className="note">
  **Exactly One Block Executes:** In an if-else structure, either the if block or the else block will execute, never both, and never neither. One path must be taken based on the condition's truth value.
</div>

## How it Works
<section id="how-it-works"></section>

1.  The `condition` associated with the `if` statement is evaluated.
2.  If the condition is `True`:
    *   The indented code block under the `if` is executed.
    *   The `else` block is skipped entirely.
3.  If the condition is `False`:
    *   The indented code block under the `if` is skipped.
    *   The indented code block under the `else` is executed.
4.  Execution continues with the next statement after the entire **if-else** structure.

### Example 1: Checking Even or Odd Numbers
<section id="example-1-checking-even-or-odd-numbers"></section>

```python
# File: even_odd.py
number_str = input("Enter an integer: ")

try:
    number = int(number_str)

    # Condition: Is the remainder when divided by 2 equal to 0?
    if number % 2 == 0:
        # This block runs if the number is even (condition is True)
        print(f"{number} is an even number.")
    else:
        # This block runs if the number is odd (condition is False)
        print(f"{number} is an odd number.")

    print("Check complete.") # This always runs afterwards

except ValueError:
    print("Invalid input. Please enter an integer.")
```

Run this code and enter an even number (like 10) and then an odd number (like 7).

### Example 2: Granting Access Based on Age
<section id="example-2-granting-access-based-on-age"></section>

```python
# File: age_access.py
age_str = input("Please enter your age: ")

try:
    age = int(age_str)
    required_age = 18

    # Condition: Is the entered age greater than or equal to the required age?
    if age >= required_age:
        # Executes if age is 18 or older
        print("Access Granted. Welcome!")
    else:
        # Executes if age is less than 18
        print("Access Denied. You must be at least 18 years old.")

except ValueError:
    print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid age as a number.")
```

### Example 3: Simple Login Result

<section id="example-3-simple-login-result"></section>

```python
# File: login_result.py
username = "admin"
password = "password123"

entered_user = input("Username: ")
entered_pass = input("Password: ")

# Condition: Do both the username AND password match?
if entered_user == username and entered_pass == password:
    # Executes if both match (condition is True)
    print("Login Successful!")
    # (Here you might redirect to a dashboard, etc.)
else:
    # Executes if either username or password (or both) is wrong
    print("Login Failed. Incorrect username or password.")

print("Login attempt processed.") # Always runs after the if-else
```

## Combining with Truthy/Falsy
<section id="combining-with-truthy-falsy"></section>
The **if-else** structure works perfectly with truthy and falsy values as well.

```python
# File: truthy_else.py
user_input = input("Enter some text (or leave blank): ")

# Condition: Is user_input truthy (i.e., not an empty string)?
if user_input:
    # Executes if user entered something
    print(f"You entered: '{user_input}'")
else:
    # Executes if user pressed Enter without typing (input is "")
    print("You didn't enter anything.")
```
