# Getting User Input & Formatted Output

## Making Programs Interactive: The `input()` Function
<section id="interactive-programs"></section>

So far, our programs have run from start to finish without any interaction. To make programs more dynamic and useful, we often need to get data from the user while the program is running. Python's built-in `input()` function allows us to do this.

The `input()` function does the following:

1.  Displays an optional prompt message on the screen to tell the user what to enter.
2.  Pauses the program execution and waits for the user to type something in the console and press Enter.
3.  Returns the text entered by the user as a **string**.

```python
# Ask the user for their name
name = input("Please enter your name: ")

# Greet the user
print(f"Hello, {name}! Welcome.")

# Ask for their favorite color
color = input("What is your favorite color? ")
print(f"Ah, {color} is a nice color!")
```

When you run this code, the program will stop at the **input()** lines, display the prompt, and wait for your keyboard input.

**Important:** The `input()` function **always** returns the user's input as a string, even if they type numbers. If you need to perform mathematical operations, you must convert the input string to a numeric type (like `int` or `float`) first.

```python
age_str = input("Enter your age: ")
print(f"Type of input initially: {type(age_str)}") # Output: <class 'str'>

# Convert the string to an integer
age_int = int(age_str)
print(f"Type after conversion: {type(age_int)}") # Output: <class 'int'>

# Now we can do calculations
age_next_year = age_int + 1
print(f"Next year you will be {age_next_year}.")

# Trying to add without conversion would cause a TypeError
# print("Next year: " + age_str + 1) # This would fail!
```

Always be prepared to handle potential `ValueError` exceptions if the user enters text that cannot be converted to the desired numeric type (e.g., typing "abc" when you try to convert to **int**). We'll cover error handling later.

## Formatted Output with F-Strings
<section id="f-strings"></section>

We've already been using f-strings (formatted string literals) sprinkled in previous examples. They are the modern and generally preferred way to embed expressions inside string literals for output formatting.

An f-string is created by prefixing a string literal with the letter `f` or `F`. Inside the string, you can embed Python expressions within curly braces `{}`. These expressions are evaluated at runtime, and their results are included in the string.

```python
item = "widgets"
quantity = 15
price_each = 2.50

# Using f-string to create a summary message
total_cost = quantity * price_each
message = f"You ordered {quantity} {item} at ${price_each} each, for a total of ${total_cost}."
print(message)
# Output: You ordered 15 widgets at $2.5 each, for a total of $37.5.
```

### Formatting Specifiers within F-Strings
<section id="f-string-formatting"></section>

F-strings allow you to control the formatting of the embedded expressions using a **format specifier**, which follows the expression inside the curly braces, separated by a colon (`:`).

Common uses include:

*   **Controlling decimal places for floats:** `:.Nf` where N is the number of decimal places.
*   **Padding and alignment:** Controlling the total width and alignment (left `<`, right `>`, center `^`).
*   **Adding signs:** Force display of + sign for positive numbers.
*   **Using commas as thousands separators:** `:,`
*   **Percentage formatting:** `:.N%`

```python
pi = 3.1415926535
amount = 12345.6789
ratio = 0.75
```
* **Format float to 2 decimal places**
```python
print(f"Pi rounded to 2 decimals: {pi:.2f}") # Output: 3.14
```
* **Format float to 4 decimal places**
```python
print(f"Pi rounded to 4 decimals: {pi:.4f}") # Output: 3.1416 (note rounding)
```
* **Format amount with comma separator and 2 decimal places**
```python
print(f"Amount: ${amount:,.2f}") # Output: $12,345.68
```
* **Pad number to a width of 10 characters, right-aligned**
```python
print(f"Padded Pi: |{pi:>10.2f}|") # Output: |      3.14|
```
* **Pad string to a width of 15 characters, center-aligned**
```python
name = "Alice"
print(f"Centered Name: |{name:^15}|") # Output: |     Alice     |
```
* **Format ratio as percentage with 1 decimal place**
```python
print(f"Ratio as percentage: {ratio:.1%}") # Output: 75.0%
```

There are many more format specifiers available. Refer to the Python documentation for a complete list.

### Example 1: Simple Calculator
<section id="simple-calculator"></section>
* **File: simple_calc.py**
```python

num1_str = input("Enter the first number: ")
num2_str = input("Enter the second number: ")
```
* **Convert input strings to floats**
```python
try:
    num1 = float(num1_str)
    num2 = float(num2_str)

    # Perform calculations
    sum_result = num1 + num2
    diff_result = num1 - num2
    prod_result = num1 * num2
    quot_result = num1 / num2 if num2 != 0 else "Undefined (division by zero)"

    # Display results using f-strings
    print(f"\n--- Results ---")
    print(f"{num1} + {num2} = {sum_result}")
    print(f"{num1} - {num2} = {diff_result}")
    print(f"{num1} * {num2} = {prod_result}")
    print(f"{num1} / {num2} = {quot_result}")

except ValueError:
    print("Invalid input. Please enter valid numbers.")
```

# Process and format the output
try:
    user_age = int(user_age_str)
    print(f"\nHello {user_name.strip().title()}!") # Clean up name input
    print(f"Nice to know you live in {user_city.strip()}.")
    print(f"Being {user_age} years old is a great age!")
except ValueError:
    print("Please enter a valid whole number for your age.")

qty3 = 5
```
* **Calculate totals**
```python
total1 = price1 * qty1
total2 = price2 * qty2
total3 = price3 * qty3
grand_total = total1 + total2 + total3
```

# Item lines
print(f"{item1:<10} {qty1:>3} {price1:>7.2f} {total1:>7.2f}")
print(f"{item2:<10} {qty2:>3} {price2:>7.2f} {total2:>7.2f}")
print(f"{item3:<10} {qty3:>3} {price3:>7.2f} {total3:>7.2f}")
print("-" * 30)
# Grand Total
print(f"{ 'GRAND TOTAL':<21} {grand_total:>7.2f}")
print("-" * 30)
