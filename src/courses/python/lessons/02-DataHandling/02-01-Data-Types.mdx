<section id="What-is-data?"></section>
Data is the information we store and manipulate in a Python program. Example: numbers (10), text ("Hello"), lists ([1,2,3]) etc. In Python, everything is treated as an object.

Every value in Python, from a simple number to a complex object, has a specific data type. This classification tells the interpreter what kind of value a variable holds, which is crucial because it determines the operations you can perform. You can check the type of any object using the built-in `type()` function.

### Introduction to Data Types
<section id="Introduction-to-data-types"></section>

Data types are classifications that specify which type of value a variable can hold and what type of mathematical, relational, or logical operations can be applied to it without causing an error. Since Python is dynamically typed, we don't declare the type, but the values we assign still have inherent types.

Understanding data types is fundamental because the type of data dictates how it can be stored, manipulated, and used in operations. Today, we'll cover the most common built-in scalar types: integers, floating-point numbers, booleans, and strings.

You can always check the type of a variable or value using the built-in `type()` function.

```python
value = 100
print(type(value)) # Output: <class 'int'>

value = "Hello"
print(type(value)) # Output: <class 'str'>
```

### 1. Integers (`int`)
<section id="Integers"></section>
Integers represent whole numbers, both positive and negative, without any decimal points. Python integers have arbitrary precision, meaning they can be as large as your computer's memory allows.

* **Integer examples**
```python
age = 30
year = 2025
count = -50
very_large_number = 1_000_000_000_000 # Underscores can be used for readability

print(age, type(age))
print(count, type(count))
print(very_large_number, type(very_large_number))
```
Common operations include standard arithmetic: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), floor division (//), modulo (%), exponentiation (**).

### 2. Floating-Point Numbers (`float`)
<section id="Floating-Point-Numbers"></section>
Floats represent real numbers, including those with decimal points. They are used for values that require more precision than integers can provide, like measurements or calculations involving fractions.

Note that floating-point arithmetic can sometimes have small precision issues due to how computers store these numbers internally (using binary approximations).


* **Float examples**
```python
price = 99.99
temperature = -5.5
pi_approx = 3.14159
scientific_notation = 6.022e23 # Represents 6.022 * 10^23

print(price, type(price))
print(temperature, type(temperature))
print(pi_approx, type(pi_approx))
print(scientific_notation, type(scientific_notation))

# Integer division results in a float
result = 10 / 4
print(result, type(result)) # Output: 2.5 <class 'float'>
```

### 3. Booleans (`bool`)
<section id="Booleans"></section>
Booleans represent one of two possible values: **True** or **False** (note the capitalization). They are fundamental for control flow (e.g., deciding whether to execute a block of code) and logical operations.

Boolean values often result from comparison operations (like `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`).

* **Boolean examples**
```python
is_logged_in = True
has_permission = False
is_greater = 10 > 5 # Comparison results in a boolean

print(is_logged_in, type(is_logged_in))
print(has_permission, type(has_permission))
print(f"Is 10 greater than 5? {is_greater}", type(is_greater))

# Booleans in conditional logic (preview)
if is_logged_in:
    print("Welcome back!")
else:
    print("Please log in.")
```
Internally, `True` is treated like the integer 1, and `False` like the integer 0 in numeric contexts.

### 4. Complex Numbers (`complex`)
<section id="Complex-Numbers"></section>
Complex numbers are used to represent numbers with both a real and an imaginary part. They are written in the form `a + bj`, where 'a' is the real part and 'b' is the imaginary part, and 'j' is the imaginary unit ($\sqrt{-1}$).


* **Complex number examples**
```python
complex_num1 = 3 + 4j
complex_num2 = 1.5 + 2j
complex_num3 = 5j # A complex number with a real part of 0

print(complex_num1, type(complex_num1))
print(complex_num2, type(complex_num2))
print(complex_num3, type(complex_num3))
```
* **Accessing the real and imaginary parts**
```python
print(f"Real part of {complex_num1}: {complex_num1.real}")
print(f"Imaginary part of {complex_num1}: {complex_num1.imag}")
```
* **Performing operations with complex numbers**
```python
sum_result = complex_num1 + complex_num2
product_result = complex_num1 * complex_num2

print(f"Sum of complex numbers: {sum_result}")
print(f"Product of complex numbers: {product_result}")
```

### 5. Strings (`str`)
<section id="Strings"></section>
Strings represent sequences of characters. They are used to store text data. In Python, strings are immutable, meaning once a string is created, it cannot be changed directly (though you can create new strings based on existing ones).

Strings can be defined using single quotes (`'...'`), double quotes (`"..."`), or triple quotes (`'''...'''` or `"""..."""`) for multi-line strings.


* **String examples**
```python
greeting = "Hello, Python!"
name = 'Alice'
multi_line_poem = """
Roses are red,
Violets are blue,
Python is fun,
And so are you!

print(greeting, type(greeting))
print(name, type(name))
print(multi_line_poem, type(multi_line_poem))

# Concatenation (joining strings)
full_greeting = greeting + " Welcome, " + name + "."
print(full_greeting)

# String repetition
separator = "-" * 20 # Creates a string of 20 hyphens
print(separator)
```
We will cover many more string operations (like finding length, accessing characters, slicing, methods) in a later lesson.

## Type Conversion
<section id="Type-Conversion"></section>
Sometimes you need to convert a value from one type to another. Python provides built-in functions for this: `int()`, `float()`, `bool()`, and `str()`.


* **Type conversion examples**
```python
num_string = "123"
num_int = int(num_string) # Convert string to integer
print(num_int, type(num_int))

price_float = 99.0
price_int = int(price_float) # Convert float to integer (truncates decimal)
print(price_int, type(price_int)) # Output: 99 <class 'int'>

count_int = 100
count_str = str(count_int) # Convert integer to string
print("The count is: " + count_str) # Now can concatenate with other strings

value = 0
is_true = bool(value) # Convert integer 0 to boolean
print(is_true, type(is_true)) # Output: False <class 'bool'>

value = "Any non-empty string"
is_true = bool(value) # Non-empty strings convert to True
print(is_true, type(is_true)) # Output: True <class 'bool'>
```
**Be careful**: converting might fail if the value isn't compatible (e.g., `int("hello")` will raise a `ValueError`).

### Example 1: Mixing Numeric Types
Operations involving `int` and `float` usually result in a `float` to maintain precision.


* **File: numeric_mixing.py**
```python
integer_val = 5
float_val = 2.5

sum_result = integer_val + float_val
product_result = integer_val * float_val

print(f"{integer_val} + {float_val} = {sum_result}")
print(f"Type of sum: {type(sum_result)}") # Output: <class 'float'>

print(f"{integer_val} * {float_val} = {product_result}")
print(f"Type of product: {type(product_result)}") # Output: <class 'float'>
```

### Example 2: String Formatting with Different Types
Using f-strings (formatted string literals) is a convenient way to embed variables of different types into strings.


* **File: f_string_example.py**
```python
item = "Laptop"
quantity = 2
unit_price = 1200.50
in_stock = True

# Create a summary string using an f-string
summary = f"Item: {item}, Quantity: {quantity}, Price: ${unit_price:.2f}, In Stock: {in_stock}"
# Note: :.2f formats the float to 2 decimal places

print(summary)
print(type(summary)) # Output: <class 'str'>
```

### Example 3: Boolean Logic Preview
Booleans are often used with logical operators `and`, `or`, `not`.


* **File: boolean_logic.py**
```python
has_key = True
knows_password = False
is_admin = False

can_enter_basic = has_key or knows_password
can_enter_admin = (has_key or knows_password) and is_admin
locked_out = not (has_key or knows_password)

print(f"Can enter basic area? {can_enter_basic}")  # True (because has_key is True)
print(f"Can enter admin area? {can_enter_admin}") # False (because is_admin is False)
print(f"Is locked out? {locked_out}")            # False (because can_enter_basic is True)
```
