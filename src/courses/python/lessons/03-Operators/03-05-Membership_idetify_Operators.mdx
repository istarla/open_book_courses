# Membership and Identity Operators

In this lesson, we will explore two more categories of Python operators: membership operators and identity operators. These are powerful tools for checking relationships between objects and values.

## Membership Operators
<section id="What-are-membership-operators?"></section>
Membership operators are used to test if a value or a variable is found in a sequence (like a string, list, tuple, or set). They return either `True` or `False`.

      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>**Operator**</th>
            <th>**Description**</th>
            <th>**Example**</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td><code class="inline">is</code></td>
            <td>Returns <code>True</code> if both variables point to the same object.</td>
            <td><code class="inline">x is y</code></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><code class="inline">is not</code></td>
            <td>Returns <code>True</code> if both variables do NOT point to the same object.</td>
            <td><code class="inline">x is not y</code></td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

### Examples of Membership Operators
<section id="Examples-of-membership-operators"></section>



* **--- Example with a string ---***
```python
message = "Hello, Python!"
print(f"'Python' in message: {'Python' in message}")      # Output: True
print(f"'Java' in message: {'Java' in message}")            # Output: False
print(f"'python' not in message: {'python' not in message}") # Output: True (case-sensitive)
```
* **--- Example with a list ---***
```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(f"'banana' in fruits: {'banana' in fruits}")        # Output: True
print(f"'grape' in fruits: {'grape' in fruits}")          # Output: False
```
* **--- Example with a tuple ---***
```python
numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
print(f"3 in numbers: {3 in numbers}")                  # Output: True
print(f"6 not in numbers: {6 not in numbers}")            # Output: True
```

Membership operators are extremely useful for conditional logic (which we'll cover soon), allowing you to check for the existence of elements without iterating through the entire sequence manually.

## Identity Operators
<section id="What-are-identity-operators?"></section>


Identity operators are used to compare the memory locations of two objects. They check if two variables refer to the **exact same object** in memory, not just if they have the same value.

To understand identity, we can use Python's built-in `id()` function, which returns the unique identity of an object. This identity is the address of the object in memory.

      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>**Operator**</th>
            <th>**Description**</th>
            <th>**Example**</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td><code class="inline">is</code></td>
            <td>Returns <code>True</code> if both variables point to the same object.</td>
            <td><code class="inline">x is y</code></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><code class="inline">is not</code></td>
            <td>Returns <code>True</code> if both variables do NOT point to the same object.</td>
            <td><code class="inline">x is not y</code></td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

### Examples of Identity Operators
<section id="Examples-of-identity-operators"></section>

Let's see how identity operators differ from the equality operator (`==`), which checks for value equality.



* **--- Example 1: Same object ---***
```python
a = 10
b = 10
# For small integers, Python often caches the objects, so they share the same memory location.
print(f"a == b: {a == b}")          # Output: True (values are equal)
print(f"a is b: {a is b}")            # Output: True (refer to the same object)
print(f"id(a): {id(a)}")
print(f"id(b): {id(b)}")
```
* **--- Example 2: Different objects with same value ---***
```python
# For mutable objects like lists, even if values are identical, they are separate objects.
list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list2 = [1, 2, 3]
list3 = list1   # Here, list3 is a reference to the same object as list1

print("\n--- Comparing lists ---")
print(f"list1 == list2: {list1 == list2}")    # Output: True (values are equal)
print(f"list1 is list2: {list1 is list2}")    # Output: False (separate objects in memory)
print(f"list1 is list3: {list1 is list3}")    # Output: True (list3 references list1's object)
print(f"id(list1): {id(list1)}")
print(f"id(list2): {id(list2)}")
print(f"id(list3): {id(list3)}")
```
* **--- Example 3: is not operator ---***
```python
c = "Hello"
d = "World"
print("\n--- Using 'is not' ---")
print(f"c is not d: {c is not d}")  # Output: True (they are different strings, different objects)
```

### When to use `==` vs `is`?

This is a common point of confusion. Remember the golden rule:

*   Use `==` to check if the **values are the same**. This is what you'll do 99% of the time when comparing numbers, strings, and lists.
*   Use `is` to check if the **objects are the same**. This is for checking object identity, which is a more specific and less common use case.
*   The most common use of `is` is to check if a variable is `None`, e.g., `if my_variable is None:`. This is considered best practice.
