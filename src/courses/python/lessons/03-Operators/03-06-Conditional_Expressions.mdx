## Introduction to Conditional Expressions
<section id="conditional-expressions"></section>

## Concise Conditionals: The Ternary Operator

Often, you'll find yourself writing simple `if-else` statements where the only purpose is to assign one of two possible values to a variable based on a condition.

For example:

```python
age = 20
status = "" # Initialize variable

if age >= 18:
    status = "Adult"
else:
    status = "Minor"

print(status) # Output: Adult
```

While this works perfectly fine, Python provides a more compact syntax for this specific scenario called a <span className="highlight">conditional expression</span>, often referred to as the <span className="highlight">ternary operator</span> (because it involves three operands).

## Syntax of Conditional Expressions
<section id="syntax-of-conditional-expressions"></section>

The structure is as follows:

```python
variable = value_if_true if condition else value_if_false
```

Let's break it down:

*   **condition**: The expression to be evaluated (must result in True or False).
*   **value_if_true**: The value that the entire expression will evaluate to if the `condition` is True.
*   **value_if_false**: The value that the entire expression will evaluate to if the `condition` is False.
*   **if` and `else**: Keywords separating the components.

The entire expression evaluates to either `value_if_true` or `value_if_false`, which is then typically assigned to a variable or used directly within another expression (like a **print** statement).

## Rewriting the Example

Using the conditional expression, the previous age example becomes much shorter:

```python
age = 20

# Assign status using a conditional expression
status = "Adult" if age >= 18 else "Minor"

print(status) # Output: Adult
```

This single line achieves the same result as the four lines of the **if-else** block used for assignment.

## When to Use Conditional Expressions
<section id="when-to-use-conditional-expressions"></section>


*   **Simple Assignments:** Ideal when you need to choose between two specific values to assign to a variable based on a condition.
*   **Inline Usage:** Can be used directly within other expressions, like **print** functions or list comprehensions (which we'll see later), to make the code more compact.

  **Readability vs. Conciseness:** While conditional expressions are concise, overusing them or nesting them can make code harder to read than a standard **if-else** block. If the logic is complex, or the **value_if_true**/**value_if_false** involve multiple steps or complex calculations, a standard **if-else** is often clearer. Use ternary operators judiciously for simple, clear-cut choices.

### Example 1: Setting a Discount Rate

```python
# File: discount_rate.py
is_member = True
quantity = 15

# Standard if-else
# if is_member:
#     discount = 0.10 # 10% discount
# else:
#     discount = 0.05 # 5% discount

# Using conditional expression
discount = 0.10 if is_member else 0.05

# Using the discount
total_price = 100
final_price = total_price * (1 - discount)

print(f"Membership Status: {is_member}")
print(f"Discount Applied: {discount:.0%}") # Format as percentage
print(f"Final Price: ${final_price:.2f}")
```

### Example 2: Pluralization in Output

```python
# File: pluralize.py
num_items = 1

# Determine the correct word ("item" or "items")
item_word = "items" if num_items != 1 else "item" # Note: Handles 0 items as "items" too

print(f"You have {num_items} {item_word} in your cart.")

# Try changing num_items to 0 or 5 and run again
num_items = 5
item_word = "items" if num_items != 1 else "item"
print(f"You have {num_items} {item_word} in your cart.")
```

### Example 3: Inline Use in Print Statement

```python
# File: inline_ternary.py
score = 65
passing_score = 60

# Use conditional expression directly inside the f-string
print(f"Your score is {score}.")
print(f"Result: {'Pass' if score >= passing_score else 'Fail'}")

# Compare to assigning first:
# result = "Pass" if score >= passing_score else "Fail"
# print(f"Result: {result}") # Does the same thing, maybe slightly clearer
```

Using it inline like this can be very convenient for simple output choices.

## Avoid Nesting Conditional Expressions

While technically possible, nesting ternary operators is generally discouraged as it quickly becomes very difficult to read.

```python
# Technically possible, but BAD PRACTICE
a = 10
b = 20
result = "A is greater" if a > b else ("B is greater" if b > a else "A and B are equal")
print(result) # Output: B is greater

# Much clearer using if-elif-else:
if a > b:
    result_clear = "A is greater"
elif b > a:
    result_clear = "B is greater"
else:
    result_clear = "A and B are equal"
print(result_clear)
```

Stick to simple, non-nested conditional expressions for clarity.
