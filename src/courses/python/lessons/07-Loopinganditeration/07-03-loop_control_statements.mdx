# Loop Control Statements (break and continue)

## Modifying Loop Execution
<section id="loop-control-statements"></section>

While `for` and `while` loops execute their blocks based on iterating through a sequence or a condition being true, sometimes you need finer control within an iteration. You might want to exit the loop prematurely or skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next one.

Python provides two main statements for this purpose, usable within both `for` and `while` loops:

*   `break`: Immediately terminates the innermost loop it's contained within. Execution resumes at the first statement **after** the loop.
*   `continue`: Skips the rest of the code **inside the current iteration** of the loop block and proceeds directly to the next iteration (for `for` loops) or re-evaluates the condition (for `while` loops).

## The break Statement
<section id="break-statement"></section>

Use break when you want to exit a loop entirely, even if the loop's normal termination condition (running out of items in a `for` loop or the condition becoming false in a `while` loop) hasn't been met.

It's often used when searching for an item or when a specific condition occurs that makes further iteration unnecessary or impossible.

```python
# File: break_example.py
print("Searching for the number 5:")
for number in range(1, 11): # Iterate from 1 to 10
    print(f"Checking {number}...")
    if number == 5:
        print("Found 5! Breaking out of the loop.")
        break # Exit the loop immediately
    # This line is skipped when number is 5 because of break
    print("...not 5 yet.")

print("\nLoop finished or was broken.") # This line runs after the loop ends

print("\nExample with while loop:")
count = 0
while True: # Potentially infinite loop
    print(f"While loop iteration {count}")
    count += 1
    if count >= 3:
        print("Count reached 3, breaking while loop.")
        break # Exit the 'infinite' loop

print("While loop finished.")
```

Notice how the loop stops as soon as `number == 5` or `count >= 3` is encountered, and the code after the `break` within the loop does not execute.

## The continue Statement
<section id="continue-statement"></section>

Use `continue` when you want to stop processing the **current** iteration but want the loop to proceed with the next one.

It's often used to skip processing for certain items in a sequence or when a specific condition means the rest of the current iteration's code should not run.

```python
# File: continue_example.py
print("Processing numbers 0 to 9, skipping multiples of 3:")
for number in range(10): # Iterate from 0 to 9
    if number % 3 == 0:
        # If the number is divisible by 3...
        print(f"Skipping {number}...")
        continue # Skip the rest of this iteration and go to the next number
    # This line only executes if the 'continue' was NOT encountered
    print(f"Processing {number}...")

print("\nLoop finished.")

print("\nExample with while loop (printing odd numbers):")
num = 0
while num < 10:
    num += 1 # Increment first
    if num % 2 == 0: # Check if even
        continue # If even, skip the print and go to the next iteration
    # Only prints if num is odd
    print(f"Odd number: {num}")

print("While loop finished.")
```

Observe how the "Processing..." message or the odd number print only occurs when the `continue` statement is **not** executed for that iteration.

> **`break` vs. `continue`**: `break` exits the **entire** loop structure. `continue` exits only the **current iteration** and proceeds to the next.

### Example 1: Finding the First Vowel
<section id="finding-the-first-vowel"></section>

```python
# File: find_vowel.py
text = "Programming"
first_vowel = None # Initialize variable to store the vowel

print(f"Searching for the first vowel in '{text}'...")
for char in text.lower(): # Iterate through lowercase characters
    if char in "aeiou":
        first_vowel = char
        print(f"Found the first vowel: '{first_vowel}'")
        break # Exit the loop once the first vowel is found

# Check if a vowel was found (first_vowel will still be None if not)
if first_vowel is None:
    print("No vowels found in the text.")

print("Search complete.")
```

### Example 2: Summing Only Positive Numbers
<section id="summing-only-positive-numbers"></section>

```python
# File: sum_positives.py
numbers = [10, -5, 20, 0, -15, 8, 3] # We'll learn about lists soon
positive_sum = 0

print(f"Numbers: {numbers}")
print("Summing only positive numbers...")
for num in numbers:
    if num <= 0:
        # If number is not positive, skip to the next number
        print(f"Skipping non-positive number: {num}")
        continue
    # This part only executes if the number is positive
    print(f"Adding {num} to sum.")
    positive_sum += num

print(f"\nSum of positive numbers: {positive_sum}")
```

### Example 3: Input Loop with Validation and Exit
<section id="input-loop-with-validation-and-exit"></section>

```python
# File: validated_input_loop.py
print("Enter positive numbers to add. Enter 0 to stop. Enter negative to skip.")
total = 0
while True: # Loop indefinitely until explicitly broken
    entry = input("> ")
    try:
        num = int(entry)
        if num == 0:
            print("Stopping input.")
            break # Exit the loop if user enters 0
        elif num < 0:
            print("Negative number entered. Skipping.")
            continue # Skip negative numbers and ask for input again
        else: # num > 0
            total += num
            print(f"Added {num}. Current total: {total}")
    except ValueError:
        print("Invalid input. Please enter an integer.")
        # Continue loop to ask for input again

print(f"\nFinal total: {total}")
```
