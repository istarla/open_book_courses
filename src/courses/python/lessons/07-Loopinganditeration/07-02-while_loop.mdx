# Control Flow - while Loops

## Looping Based on a Condition
<section id="introduction-to-while-loop"></section>

Yesterday, we explored `for` loops, which are excellent for iterating over sequences or a known number of times using `range()`. However, sometimes you need to repeat a block of code as long as a certain condition remains true, without knowing beforehand exactly how many iterations that will take.

This is the purpose of the `while` loop. It repeatedly executes a target statement as long as a given condition is true.

## while Loop Syntax
<section id="while-loop-syntax"></section>

The structure of a `while` loop is:

```python
while condition:
    # Code block to execute as long as condition is True
    statement1
    statement2
    # IMPORTANT: Something inside the loop must eventually
    # change the condition to False to avoid an infinite loop.
# Code here executes after the condition becomes False and the loop terminates
statement_after_loop
```

* **## Key components:**
*   **while**: The keyword that starts the loop.
*   **condition**: An expression that evaluates to a Boolean value (`True` or `False`).
*   **:**: A colon marks the end of the `while` loop header.
*   **Indented Block:** The block of code that will be executed repeatedly as long as the `condition` evaluates to `True`.

## How it Works
<section id="how-it-works"></section>

1.  The `condition` is evaluated *before* entering the loop for the first time.
2.  If the condition is `True`, the indented code block is executed.
3.  After the block finishes executing, the program *returns* to the `while` line, and the `condition` is evaluated *again*.
4.  If the condition is still `True`, the block executes again. This repeats.
5.  If the condition evaluates to `False` (either initially or after an iteration), the loop terminates, and the program skips the indented block and continues with the statement immediately following the loop.

> **Beware of Infinite Loops!**
> A crucial aspect of `while` loops is ensuring that the condition will eventually become false. If the condition always remains true, the loop will run forever, creating an infinite loop that will likely hang your program. You usually need to include logic within the loop block that modifies the variables involved in the condition.

### Example 1: Simple Counter with while
<section id="simple-counter-with-while"></section>

This achieves a similar result to a `for` loop with `range()` but illustrates the `while` structure.

```python
# File: while_counter.py
count = 0 # Initialize the counter variable

print("Starting the while loop:")
# Condition: Loop as long as 'count' is less than 5
while count < 5:
    print(f"Count is currently: {count}")
    # IMPORTANT: Update the counter variable inside the loop
    count += 1 # Increment count by 1 (count = count + 1)
    # Without this line, count would always be 0, and the loop would be infinite!

print(f"Loop finished. Final count is: {count}") # Output: 5
```

### Example 2: Waiting for Specific User Input
<section id="waiting-for-specific-user-input"></section>

A common use case for `while` is repeating a prompt until the user enters valid input or a specific command.

```python
# File: input_validation.py
user_input = "" # Initialize with a value that doesn't match 'quit'

print("Enter text (type 'quit' to exit):")

# Condition: Loop as long as the user_input is not 'quit'
while user_input.lower() != "quit":
    user_input = input("> ") # Get input inside the loop
    if user_input.lower() != "quit":
        print(f"You entered: {user_input}")
        # Process the input here if needed
    # The condition is checked again at the top of the loop after input

print("Exiting program.")
```

This loop continues until the user types "quit" (case-insensitive).

### Example 3: Simple Guessing Game (Conceptual)
<section id="simple-guessing-game-conceptual"></section>

Simulating turns in a game until a condition is met.


* **File: guessing_game.py**
```python
import random # Import module for random numbers

secret_number = random.randint(1, 10) # Generate random number between 1 and 10
guess = 0 # Initialize guess to a value that won't match
attempts = 0

print("Guess the number between 1 and 10!")
```
* **Condition: Loop as long as the guess is not correct**
```python
while guess != secret_number:
    guess_str = input(f"Attempt {attempts + 1}: Enter your guess: ")
    try:
        guess = int(guess_str)
        attempts += 1 # Increment attempts

        # Provide feedback (could use if/elif/else here too)
        if guess < secret_number:
            print("Too low!")
        elif guess > secret_number:
            print("Too high!")
        # If guess == secret_number, the loop condition becomes false
        # and the loop will terminate *before* printing the success message below.

    except ValueError:
        print("Invalid input. Please enter a number.")
        # Continue loop without incrementing attempts for invalid input

# This code runs *after* the loop terminates (meaning guess == secret_number)
print(f"\nCongratulations! You guessed the number {secret_number} in {attempts} attempts.")
```
