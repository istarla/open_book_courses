# Lambda Functions

## Small, Anonymous Functions
<section id="small-anonymous-functions"></section>

We've learned how to define functions using the def keyword. These are typically used for larger blocks of code or for functions that will be reused multiple times by name.

Python also provides a way to create small, simple, anonymous functions (functions without a formal name defined via def) using the lambda keyword. These are often called lambda functions or lambda expressions.

Lambda functions are restricted to a single expression. They can take any number of arguments but can only have one expression, the result of which is implicitly returned. They cannot contain complex statements like loops, `if-else` blocks spanning multiple lines (though conditional expressions are allowed), or `try-except` blocks.

## Syntax of Lambda Functions
<section id="syntax-of-lambda-functions"></section>

The basic syntax is:

```python
lambda arguments: expression
```

*   `lambda`: Keyword indicating the start of a lambda function.
*   `arguments`: One or more arguments the function accepts, separated by commas (just like parameters in a **def** statement).
*   `:`: Colon separating the arguments from the expression.
*   `expression`: A single expression that uses the arguments. The result of this expression is automatically returned by the lambda function.

## Comparing **lambda** with **def**
<section id="comparing-lambda-with-def"></section>

Let's compare a simple function defined using **def** and an equivalent lambda function:

* **Using def**
```python

def double(x):
  return x * 2

result_def = double(5)
print(f"Result from def function: {result_def}")
```

* **Equivalent using lambda**
```python
# Assigning the lambda function to a variable (less common, but shows equivalence)
double_lambda = lambda x: x * 2

result_lambda = double_lambda(5)
print(f"Result from lambda function: {result_lambda}")

# Lambda functions are objects just like regular functions
print(f"Type of double_lambda: {type(double_lambda)}") # Output: <class 'function'>
```

While you **can** assign a lambda function to a variable, it slightly defeats the purpose of them being "anonymous". The primary use case for lambdas isn't assignment, but rather passing simple functions as arguments to other functions.

## When to Use Lambda Functions
<section id="when-to-use-lambda-functions"></section>

Lambda functions shine when you need a small, temporary function for a short period, especially as arguments to higher-order functions (functions that take other functions as arguments).

Common scenarios:

*   **Sorting (`sort()`, `sorted()`):** Providing a custom key for sorting complex objects.
*   **Mapping (`map()`):** Applying a simple transformation to every item in an iterable.
*   **Filtering (`filter()`):** Selecting items from an iterable based on a simple condition.
*   GUI frameworks (like Tkinter, PyQt) for simple callback handlers.

(We haven't covered **map** and **filter** yet, but they are classic examples where lambdas are useful).

**Readability:** While lambdas can be concise, complex lambda functions can become hard to read. If the logic requires more than a very simple expression, defining a regular function with **def** is usually clearer and preferred. PEP 8 (the style guide) generally recommends using **def** over assigning lambdas to variables.

### Example 1: Simple Arithmetic Lambda
<section id="example-1-simple-arithmetic-lambda"></section>



* **File: arithmetic_lambda.py**
```python

# Lambda function for adding three numbers
add_three = lambda a, b, c: a + b + c
result = add_three(5, 10, 15)
print(f"Result of add_three(5, 10, 15): {result}") # Output: 30
```
* **Lambda function using a conditional expression**
```python
max_val = lambda x, y: x if x > y else y
result_max = max_val(100, 50)
print(f"Result of max_val(100, 50): {result_max}") # Output: 100
```

### Example 2: Using Lambda with **sorted()**
<section id="example-2-using-sorted"></section>

Sorting a list of tuples based on the second element of each tuple.


* **File: lambda_sort.py**
```python
points = [(1, 5), (3, 2), (5, 8), (2, 1)]
print(f"Original points: {points}")
```
* **Sort based on the first element (default tuple sorting)**
```python
points.sort() # Sorts in-place based on first element, then second if first is equal
print(f"Sorted by first element: {points}")
```
* **Sort based on the second element using a lambda as the key**
```python
# The key function takes one argument (a tuple from the list)
# and returns the value to sort by (the second element, index 1).
points.sort(key=lambda point_tuple: point_tuple[1])
print(f"Sorted by second element: {points}") # Output: [(2, 1), (3, 2), (1, 5), (5, 8)]
```
* **Using sorted() to create a new sorted list (original unchanged)**
```python
points_original = [(1, 5), (3, 2), (5, 8), (2, 1)]
sorted_by_y = sorted(points_original, key=lambda p: p[1])
print(f"\nOriginal points (unchanged): {points_original}")
print(f"New list sorted by y: {sorted_by_y}")
```

### Example 3: Using Lambda with **filter()** (Conceptual Preview)
<section id="example-3-using-filter"></section>


**filter(function, iterable)** creates an iterator that yields items from the iterable for which the function returns True.


* **File: lambda_filter.py**
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
print(f"Original numbers: {numbers}")
```

* **Use filter with a lambda to get only even numbers**
```python
# The lambda takes a number x and returns True if x is even
even_numbers_iterator = filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers)
```
* **Convert the iterator to a list to see the results**
```python
even_numbers_list = list(even_numbers_iterator)
print(f"Even numbers (using filter and lambda): {even_numbers_list}") # Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```
* **Equivalent using list comprehension (often preferred for simple cases)**
```python
even_comp = [x for x in numbers if x % 2 == 0]
print(f"Even numbers (using list comprehension): {even_comp}")
```
