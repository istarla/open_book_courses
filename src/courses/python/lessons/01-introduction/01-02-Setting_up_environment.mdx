      # &#10;        Setting Up Your Python Environment&#10;      

      ## why set up environment
      
      ## <section id="why-set-up-environment"></section>
      &#10;        Before you start writing Python code, you need to ensure Python is
        installed on your computer and you have the right tools to write and run
        your programs efficiently. This setup is called your development
        environment.
      

      
      ## <section id="Installation"></section>
      &#10;        Python might already be installed on your system, especially if you're
        using Linux or macOS. However, it might be an older version (Python 2).
        We need Python 3.
      
      
     ## Installation
      Open your terminal or command prompt and type:
          python <span class="token operator">-</span><span class="token operator">-</span>version
    <span class="token comment"># or maybe</span>
    python3 <span class="token operator">-</span><span class="token operator">-</span>version<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span><span></span><span></span></span>
      &#10;        If you see a version number starting with 3 (e.g., Python 3.10.4),
        you're likely good to go. If not, or if the command isn't found, you
        need to install it.
      

      
      ### 1. Installation Steps
      <section id="Installation-Steps"></section>

        
              **Windows:**
              
Python doesn't come prepackaged in Windows, but that doesn’t mean Windows users cannot be flexible with Python.  
Some operating systems such as **Linux** come with the Python package manager pre-installed, which can be used to install and manage Python easily.

              
                    **Step 1: Go to the official Python website:**
                      [python.org/downloads/windows/](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)
                      
                     ![downloaded](/images/download_pythonlink.png)

                    
                    **Step 2: Download the latest stable release installer:**
                      Download the latest stable release installer (e.g., Python 3.x.y).
                      Choose the 64-bit installer if you have a 64-bit system.
                    ![downloaded](/images/Download_py.png)

                    **Step 3: Run the installer:**
                      Run the installer.
                      **Crucially, check the box that says "Add Python 3.x to
                        PATH"**
                      during the installation. This makes Python accessible from the
                      command line.
                      ![downloaded](/images/images.png)
                    
                        1. Choose "Install Now" for the recommended setup.
                         ![downloaded](/images/Set_up.png)
                        2. Verify the installation by opening Command Prompt or PowerShell
                      and typing **python --version**.
                           ![downloaded](/images/sucessfully_py.png)
                    
              **macOS:**

              
                    **Step 1: Go to the official Python website:**
                      [python.org/downloads/macos/](https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/)
                      ![downloaded](/images/Mac_os.png)
                    
                    **Step 2: Download the macOS 64-bit installer package:**
                      Download the macOS 64-bit installer package.
                     ![downloaded](/images/Mac_version.png)
                    **Step 3: Run the installer package:**
                      Run the installer package, following the prompts.
                    ![downloaded](/images/sucessful_macos.png)
                    **Step 4: Verify the installation:**
                      Verify the installation by opening Terminal (Applications &gt;
                      Utilities &gt; Terminal) and typing
                      **python3 --version**. (macOS often comes with Python
                      2 accessible via **python**, so use
                      **python3**).
                      ![downloaded](/images/installer_macos.png)
                    
                        
                    
                     
                  
            
     
              **Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):**
              
                        
                      ![downloaded](/images/Linux.png)
                    

                    
                        **Step 2: Install Python 3 if not installed:**
                      If not installed or you need a specific version, use the package
                      manager:
                     ![downloaded](/images/Linux_step.png)
                  
              
            
        
              **Linux (Fedora):**
              
                        1. Check with **python3 --version**.
                        ![downloaded](/images/python_linux.png)
                        1. Install using dnf:
                         ![downloaded](/images/Dnf_image.png)
             
      

      
      ## &#10;        2. Writing Code: Text Editors vs. IDEs&#10; 
      <section id="TestEditor"></section>
     
      &#10;        You need a place to write your Python code (.py files). You have several
        options:
         
   1. **Simple Text Editors:** Notepad (Windows), TextEdit (Mac), Gedit (Linux). Functional, but lack helpful features for coding.
   2. **Code Editors:** Offer syntax highlighting, code completion suggestions, and often terminal integration. Great choices include.
         * Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/) – Free, highly popular, extensible.(Recommended)
         * Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) – Fast, powerful, paid with free trial.
         * Atom](https://atom.io/) – Free, customizable, developed by GitHub.
3. **Integrated Development Environments (IDEs):** Provide a full suite of tools including code editors, debuggers, project management, version control integration, etc. Often more resource-intensive but very powerful for larger projects.
         * PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) – Very popular, feature-rich Python IDE. Has a free Community edition and a paid Professional edition.(Highly Recommended for larger projects)
         * Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/) – Often included with Anaconda, focused on scientific computing.
4. **Recommendation for Beginners:** Start with a good code
editor like VS Code. It's powerful yet relatively easy to learn. Install
        the official Python extension for the best experience.

      ## 3. Running Python Code
      <section id="Running-Python-Code"></section>
      &#10;        There are two primary ways to run Python code: 
      
      ### a) Interactive Mode (REPL)
      &#10;        REPL stands for Read-Eval-Print Loop. It's a quick way to test small
        snippets of Python code without creating a file.
      
      &#10;        Open your terminal or command prompt and type **python** or
        **python3**
        (depending on your system/installation):
          ```python
python3
Python 3.10.4 (...) on ...
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> print("Hello from the REPL!")
Hello from the REPL!
>>> 5 * 8
40
>>> exit()
```
The `>>>` is the Python prompt waiting for your command.  
Type **exit()** or press **Ctrl + D** (Linux/Mac) or **Ctrl + Z** then **Enter** (Windows) to leave the REPL.

---

### b) Running Python Files

This is how you'll typically run your programs.

1. Create a file using your text/code editor (e.g., `hello.py`).
2. Write your Python code in the file.
3. Save the file.
4. Open your terminal or command prompt.
5. Navigate to the directory where you saved the file using the `cd` (change directory) command.
6. Run the file using the Python interpreter:

```bash
# Assuming hello.py is in the current directory
python3 hello.py
```
## Example 1: Running the REPL

Follow the steps above to open the REPL and try typing a few commands like `2 + 2` or `print('Test')`.

```bash
# No code file here - this is done in the terminal directly.
# Open terminal -> type 'python3' -> press Enter
# Then type:
2 + 2
# Press Enter. You should see '4'.

print("This is interactive!")
# Press Enter. You should see the text.

exit()
# Press Enter to leave.
```
## Example 2: Creating and Running a .py File

1.Create a file named greeting.py.

2.Put the following code inside:
```python
# greeting.py
name = "Alice"
print(f"Hello, {name}!")  # We'll learn about f-strings later
print("Welcome to Day 2.")
```
3.Save the file.

4.Open  your terminal or command prompt.

5.Run:
python3 greeting.py

Output in terminal:
```python
# greeting.py
Hello, Alice!
Welcome to Day 2.
```
## Example 3: Verifying Installation Path (Conceptual)

Sometimes you need to know where Python is installed.
The specific command varies by OS, but conceptually, you're asking the system "where is python3?". 
On Linux/macOS:

```bash
which python3
Example Output: /usr/bin/python3 or /usr/local/bin/python3
```
On Windows:

```bash
where python3
C:\Users\YourUser\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310\python.exe
```
 
Do you want me to also make the examples inline code styled consistently?
