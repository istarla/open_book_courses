# Your First Python Program & Basic Syntax

## The "Hello, World!" Program
<section id="hello-world"></section>
In programming tradition, the first program you often write in a new language is one that simply displays the text "Hello, World!" on the screen. It's a basic check to ensure your environment is set up correctly and to introduce the fundamental concept of output.

Create a new file named `hello_world.py` using your code editor and type the following single line of code:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

Save the file. Now, open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and run it using:

```bash
python3 hello_world.py
```

You should see the following output:

```python
Hello, World!
```

Congratulations! You've written and executed your first Python program.

## Understanding the Code: print()

Let's break down that simple line:

- **print**: This is a built-in Python function. A function is a block of reusable code that performs a specific action. The `print()` function's action is to display output to the console (your terminal screen).
- **()**: The parentheses after the function name are used to call the function and pass information to it.
- **"Hello, World!"**: This is the information (called an argument or parameter) we are passing to the `print()` function. In this case, it's a sequence of characters enclosed in double quotes, known as a string. The function will display this exact string.

## Key Python Syntax Concepts
<section id="key-syntax-concepts"></section>
Python's syntax is designed for readability. Here are some fundamental rules:
*   **Statements**  
   A statement is an instruction that the Python interpreter can execute. Our `print("Hello, World!")` line is a single statement. Usually, each statement is written on its own line.

   ```python
   # This program has two statements
   print("First statement.")
   print("Second statement.")
   ```
*   **Indentation**  
   Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line. Unlike many other languages that use curly braces `{}` to define blocks of code (like loops or function bodies), Python uses indentation.

   This is a crucial aspect of Python syntax. Consistent indentation (usually 4 spaces per level) is mandatory. You'll see this in action when we cover control flow (like if statements and loops) later. Incorrect indentation will cause errors.

   ```python
   # Correct Indentation (Conceptual Example - 'if' not covered yet)
   if True:
       print("This line is indented")  # Part of the 'if' block
       print("This line is also indented")  # Also part of the block
   print("This line is not indented")  # Not part of the 'if' block

   # Incorrect Indentation (will cause an IndentationError)
   # if True:
   # print("This will cause an error")
   ```

Most code editors automatically handle indentation for you, but it's essential to understand its significance.
## Comments
<section id="Comments"></section>
Comments are parts of the code that are ignored by the Python interpreter. They are used to explain the code to human readers.

## Single-line comments

Start with a hash symbol `#`. Everything from the `#` to the end of the line is a comment.

## Multi-line comments (Docstrings)

While Python doesn't have official multi-line comment syntax like some languages (e.g., `/* ... */`), multi-line strings enclosed in triple quotes (`"""..."""` or `'''...'''`) are often used for this purpose, especially as documentation strings (docstrings) at the beginning of functions or modules.

```python
# This is a single-line comment explaining the next line
print("Hello again!") # This is an inline comment

"""
This is a multi-line string often used as a comment block.
It can span multiple lines and is useful for longer explanations.
Technically, it's a string that isn't assigned to anything,
so Python ignores it during execution unless it's a docstring.
"""
print("Comments are useful!")
```

## Case Sensitivity
<section id="Case-Sensitivity"></section>
Python is case-sensitive. This means that `myVariable`, `myvariable`, and `MYVARIABLE` are treated as three distinct identifiers. Function names and keywords are also case-sensitive (`print` is valid, `Print` is not).

```python
message = "Case matters"
# print(Message) # This would cause a NameError because 'Message' is not defined
print(message)   # This works
```

### Example 1: Multiple Print Statements

Using the `print()` function multiple times.

```python
# File: multiple_prints.py
print("Line 1")
print("Line 2")
print("Line 3 is the last line.")
```

Run `python3 multiple_prints.py`. Output:

```python
Line 1
Line 2
Line 3 is the last line.
```

### Example 2: Demonstrating Comments

Showing how comments are ignored.

* **File: comments_example.py**
```python

# This line will print a greeting
print("Welcome!")

# The following line is commented out and will not execute
# print("This won't appear")

print("End of program.") # Program finished
```

Run `python3 comments_example.py`. Output:

```python
Welcome!
End of program.
```

### Example 3: Basic Output Formatting (End Parameter)

By default, `print()` adds a newline character at the end. You can change this using the `end` parameter.

```python
# File: end_param_example.py
print("Hello", end=" ") # End with a space instead of newline
print("World", end="!") # End with an exclamation mark
print() # Print a blank line (default end='\n')
print("This is on a new line.")
```

Run `python3 end_param_example.py`. Output:

```python
Hello World!
This is on a new line.
```
