## What is Python?

Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive, and object-oriented scripting language. Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently where other languages use punctuation, and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages.

*   **Interpreted:** Python code is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not need to compile your program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and PHP.
*   **Interactive:** You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with the interpreter directly to write your programs.
*   **Object-Oriented:** Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that encapsulates code within objects.
*   **High-Level:** Python is a high-level language. When you write programs in Python, you never need to bother about the low-level details, such as managing the memory used by your program.
*   **Extensible:** You can add low-level modules to the Python interpreter. These modules enable programmers to add to or customize their tools to be more efficient.
*   **Portable:** Python can run on a wide variety of hardware platforms and has the same interface on all platforms.
*   **Easy to Learn:** Python has few keywords, simple structure, and a clearly defined syntax. This allows the student to pick up the language quickly.
*   **Easy to Read:** Python code is more clearly defined and visible to the eyes.
*   **Easy to Maintain:** Python's source code is fairly easy-to-maintain.
*   **Large Standard Library:** Python's bulk of the library is very portable and cross-platform compatible on UNIX, Windows, and Macintosh.

## A Brief History of Python
Python was conceived in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC language (itself inspired by SETL), capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system. Its implementation began in December 1989.

Guido van Rossum is Python's principal author, and his continuing central role in deciding the direction of Python is reflected in the title given to him by the Python community, Benevolent Dictator For Life (BDFL) - though he stepped down from this role in July 2018. Python was named after the BBC TV show "Monty Python's Flying Circus".

Python 2.0 was released in October 2000. Python 3.0 was released in December 2008. It was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible. Python 2 was officially discontinued in 2020. This course focuses on Python 3.

## Common Uses of Python

Python is used in a vast range of applications, including:

*   **Web Development (Server-Side):** PythonFrameworks like Django, Flask, Pyramid
*   **Data Science & Machine Learning:** Libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch
*   **Automation & Scripting:** PythonAutomating repetitive tasks, system administration
*   **Software Development:** Build control, management, and testing
*   **Desktop GUIs:** Libraries like Tkinter, PyQt, Kivy
*   **Game Development:** Libraries like Pygame
*   **Scientific and Numeric Computing:** Libraries like SciPy
*   **Education:** Due to its simple syntax, it's often the first language taught in schools.

## Why Learn Python?


Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages globally. Its readability makes it easy to learn, while its power and flexibility make it suitable for complex applications. The large and active community provides extensive libraries, frameworks, and support. Job prospects for Python developers are excellent across many industries.

### Example 1: Hello, World!
Even without a formal introduction to syntax, you can see how readable Python can be. This code prints a message to the console.




<img src="/src/courses/python/images/hello.png" alt="variable" className="w-150 h-100 mx-auto" />


### Example 2: Basic Calculation
Python can be used as a simple calculator.

```python
result = (5 + 3) * 2
print("The result of (5 + 3) * 2 is:")
print(result)
```

### Example 3: Multi-line Statement (Conceptual)
Python typically uses newlines to end statements. We'll cover syntax details soon, but this shows a simple assignment.

```python
message = "Python is versatile"
print(message)
message = "and easy to learn."
print(message)
```
