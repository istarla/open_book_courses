# Variables, Naming Conventions & Comments

## What are Variables?

<section id="What-are-variables?"></section>
In programming, a variable is like a container used to store data values.
Instead of using the data directly every time, you can give it a name (the
variable name) and refer to it by that name. This makes code more readable and
easier to manage.

Think of it like labeling a box. The box holds something (the data), and the label (the variable name) tells you what's inside or how you can refer to it.

In Python, you create a variable the moment you first assign a value to it. The assignment operator is the equals sign (`=`).

### Creating variables and assigning values

```python
message = "This is stored in a variable" # Assigning a string
count = 10                           # Assigning an integer
price = 99.95                        # Assigning a float
is_active = True                     # Assigning a boolean
```

### Using variables

```python
print(message)
print(count)
print("The price is:", price)
print("User status:", is_active)
```

## Dynamic Typing

<section id="Dynamic-Typing"></section>
Python is dynamically typed. This means you don't have to explicitly declare the
type of a variable when you create it. Python figures out the type based on the
value you assign. Furthermore, you can change the type of data stored in a
variable by assigning a value of a different type to it later.

```python
my_variable = 100      # my_variable is now an integer
print(my_variable)
print(type(my_variable)) # Check the type using the type() function

my_variable = "Now I'm a string" # Reassigning with a different type
print(my_variable)
print(type(my_variable))

my_variable = 3.14     # Reassigning again
print(my_variable)
print(type(my_variable))
```

While flexible, changing variable types excessively can sometimes make code harder to understand. It's generally good practice to keep the type consistent for a given variable's purpose.

## Variable Naming Rules and Conventions

<section id="variable-naming-rules-and-conventions"></section>
Choosing good variable names is crucial for writing readable and maintainable
code.

### Rules (Mandatory):

- Variable names must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (\_).
- They cannot start with a number (0-9).
- They can only contain alpha-numeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) and underscores (\_).
- Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age, and AGE are three different variables).
- You cannot use Python keywords (reserved words like if, else, while, def, class, print, etc.) as variable names.

### Valid variable names

```python
my_var = 1
_count = 2
user_name = "Alice"
speed1 = 99

#Invalid variable names
1. 2speed = 100
2. user-name = "Bob"
3. class = "Economy"
```

## Identifiers

<section id="identifiers"></section>
Identifiers in Python are names given to variables, functions, classes, or
objects. They can include letters, digits, and underscores but cannot start with
a digit, contain spaces or special characters, or use reserved keywords.
Identifiers are case-sensitive, so `name` and `Name` are different.

## Valid and Invalid Identifiers

        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Valid Identifiers</th>

            <td>Another example of a reserved keyword.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="valid-code">`a_very_long_variable_name_that_is_still_valid`</td>
            <td>Length does not affect validity.</td>
            <td class="invalid-code">`if`</td>
            <td>Cannot be a reserved keyword.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="valid-code">`_`</td>
            <td>A single underscore is a valid identifier.</td>
            <td class="invalid-code">`my.variable`</td>
            <td>Dots (`.`) are not allowed.</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
                                        

## Conventions (Recommended Best Practices - PEP 8):

PEP 8 is the official style guide for Python code. Following it makes your code consistent and readable by other Python developers.

- Use lowercase letters for variable names.
- Separate words in a variable name with an underscore (`_`). This style is called snake_case.
- Choose names that are descriptive and indicate the variable's purpose (e.g., `customer_name` instead of `cn`, `total_price` instead of `tp`).
- Avoid using single letters like `l` (lowercase L), `O` (uppercase O), or `I` (uppercase I) as they can be confused with numbers 1 and 0.

```python
## Good variable names (following conventions)
- `first_name` = "Guido"
- `item_count` = 5
- `is_valid_input` = False
- `total_calculation_result` = 105.7
```
* **Less readable names (avoid these)**
```python
- `fn` = "Guido"
- `ic` = 5
- `x` = False
- `result` = 105.7 # (Could be okay, but 'total_calculation_result' is more descriptive)
```

## Revisiting Comments

<section id="Revisiting Comments"></section>
Comments are essential for explaining why your code does something, or
clarifying complex parts. Good variable names reduce the need for obvious
comments.

- Use comments to explain non-obvious logic.
- Use comments to document assumptions.
- Keep comments concise and up-to-date with the code.

```python
# Constants (often named in ALL_CAPS by convention)
`TAX_RATE` = 0.08 # 8% sales tax rate
# Calculate the final price including tax


subtotal = 150.00  # The price before tax
tax_amount = subtotal * TAX_RATE  # Calculate the tax amount
final_price = subtotal + tax_amount  # Add tax to subtotal for the final price

print(f"Subtotal: ${subtotal:.2f}")  # Using f-strings for formatted output
print(f"Tax: ${tax_amount:.2f}")
print(f"Final Price: ${final_price:.2f}")


# This comment explains a specific choice or assumption if needed
# Using f-strings (like f"...") allows embedding variables directly in strings
# The :.2f formats the number to 2 decimal places
```

## Example 1: Assigning and Reassigning Variables

```python
# File: variable_reassignment.py
planet = "Earth"
print("Current planet:", planet)

# Reassign the variable
planet = "Mars"
print("Destination planet:", planet)

# Assign a number
distance_km = 225000000  # Approximate average distance
print("Distance to Mars (km):", distance_km)
```

## Example 2: Multiple Assignments

You can assign the same value to multiple variables simultaneously, or assign multiple values to multiple variables.

```python
# File: multiple_assignments.py

# Assign same value to multiple variables
x = y = z = 0
print(x, y, z)  # Output: 0 0 0

# Assign multiple values to multiple variables (unpacking)
a, b, c = 5, 10, "hello"
print(a)      # Output: 5
print(b)      # Output: 10
print(c)      # Output: hello
```

## Example 3: Using Variables in Calculations

```python
# File: calculation_with_vars.py

length = 12.5
width = 4.0

# Calculate area
area = length * width
print("Length:", length)
print("Width:", width)
print("Area:", area)

# Calculate perimeter
perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
print("Perimeter:", perimeter)
```
